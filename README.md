# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The e-commerce data analysis project aims to extract actionable insights and trends from the provided dataset to support data-driven decision-making for the business. By employing various analytical techniques, statistical methods, and visualization tools, we seek to identify patterns, customer behaviors, product preferences, and market trends. The project will provide valuable insights that can guide the overall business growth.
My goal is to explore and clean the data to ensure data accuracy, and identify market trands;

## Process
### step 1: Data collection and profiling - profiled excel tables for understanding, and imported the needed data set to the server for further examinations and profiling
### step 2: Data cleaning - Performed data cleaning and tranformation using postgres , converted data types and nomalised data and preformed caculations  
### step 3: Data analysis - performed data analysis using many sql queries to analyze datasets to get insights 
### step 4: Quanlity assurance analysis - performed QA analysis to check for missing values and incomplete dataset  

## Results
Identify the month with the highest number of orders as July 2017. Additionally, determine the city and country that generated the highest revenue, along with the top-selling products.
with the information available, I can infer that USA had the highest revenue compared to other countries


## Challenges 
The available information did not provide explicit details about the data sources or the primary tables serving as the source of truth. Further clarity on the underlying data tables is necessary for a comprehensive analysis.

## Future Goals
1, To normalise the tables using the INF, to remove all repeating data.  
2, More data cleaning.
3, Identify more outliers
4, More interaction with the business to understand the source of truth.
